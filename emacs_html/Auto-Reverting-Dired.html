<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Auto-Reverting-Dired-buffers"><span>19.5.1.2 Auto Reverting Dired buffers<a class="copiable-link" href="#Auto-Reverting-Dired-buffers"> &para;</a></span></h4>

<p>Dired buffers only auto-revert when the file list of the buffer&rsquo;s main
directory changes (e.g., when a new file is added or deleted).  They
do not auto-revert when information about a particular file changes
(e.g., when the size changes) or when inserted subdirectories change.
To be sure that <em class="emph">all</em> listed information is up to date, you have
to manually revert using <kbd class="kbd">g</kbd>, <em class="emph">even</em> if auto-reverting is
enabled in the Dired buffer.  Sometimes, you might get the impression
that modifying or saving files listed in the main directory actually
does cause auto-reverting.  This is because making changes to a file,
or saving it, very often causes changes in the directory itself; for
instance, through backup files or auto-save files.  However, this is
not guaranteed.
</p>
<p>If the Dired buffer is marked modified and there are no changes you
want to protect, then most of the time you can make auto-reverting
resume by manually reverting the buffer using <kbd class="kbd">g</kbd>.  There is one
exception.  If you flag or mark files, you can safely revert the
buffer.  This will not erase the flags or marks (unless the marked
file has been deleted, of course).  However, the buffer will stay
modified, even after reverting, and auto-reverting will not resume.
This is because, if you flag or mark files, you may be working on the
buffer and you might not want the buffer to change without warning.
If you want auto-reverting to resume in the presence of marks and
flags, mark the buffer non-modified using <kbd class="kbd">M-~</kbd>.  However, adding,
deleting or changing marks or flags will mark it modified again.
</p>
<p>Remote Dired buffers are currently not auto-reverted.  Neither are
Dired buffers for which you used shell wildcards or file arguments to
list only some of the files.  <samp class="file">*Find*</samp> and <samp class="file">*Locate*</samp>
buffers do not auto-revert either.
</p>
<p>Note that auto-reverting Dired buffers may not work satisfactorily on
some systems.
