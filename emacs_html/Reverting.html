<h3 class="section" id="Reverting-a-Buffer"><span>19.4 Reverting a Buffer<a class="copiable-link" href="#Reverting-a-Buffer"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dfine_002dgrain"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-drastic-changes"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-reread-a-file"></a>

<p>If you have made extensive changes to a file-visiting buffer and
then change your mind, you can <em class="dfn">revert</em> the changes and go back to
the saved version of the file.  To do this, type <kbd class="kbd">C-x x g</kbd>.  Since
reverting unintentionally could lose a lot of work, Emacs asks for
confirmation first if the buffer is modified.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> command tries to position point in such a
way that, if the file was edited only slightly, you will be at
approximately the same part of the text as before.  But if you have
made major changes, point may end up in a totally different location.
</p>
<p>Reverting marks the buffer as not modified.  However, it adds the
reverted changes as a single modification to the buffer&rsquo;s undo history
(see <a class="pxref" href="Undo.html">Undo</a>).  Thus, after reverting, you can type <kbd class="kbd">C-/</kbd> or its
aliases to bring the reverted changes back, if you happen to change
your mind.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dwith_002dfine_002dgrain_002dmax_002dseconds"></a>
<p>To revert a buffer more conservatively, you can use the command
<code class="code">revert-buffer-with-fine-grain</code>.  This command acts like
<code class="code">revert-buffer</code>, but it tries to be as non-destructive as
possible, making an effort to preserve all markers, properties and
overlays in the buffer.  Since reverting this way can be very slow
when you have made a large number of changes, you can modify the
variable <code class="code">revert-buffer-with-fine-grain-max-seconds</code> to
specify a maximum amount of seconds that replacing the buffer
contents this way should take.  Note that it is not ensured that the
whole execution of <code class="code">revert-buffer-with-fine-grain</code> won&rsquo;t take
longer than this.
</p>
<p>Some kinds of buffers that are not associated with files, such as
Dired buffers, can also be reverted.  For them, reverting means
recalculating their contents.  Buffers created explicitly with
<kbd class="kbd">C-x b</kbd> cannot be reverted; <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> reports an error
if you try.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dwithout_002dquery"></a>
<p>When you edit a file that changes automatically and frequently&mdash;for
example, a log of output from a process that continues to run&mdash;it may
be useful for Emacs to revert the file without querying you.  To
request this behavior, set the variable <code class="code">revert-without-query</code> to
a list of regular expressions.  When a file name matches one of these
regular expressions, <code class="code">find-file</code> and <code class="code">revert-buffer</code> will
revert it automatically if it has changed&mdash;provided the buffer itself
is not modified.  (If you have edited the text, it would be wrong to
discard your changes.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-x-g"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dquick_002dshort_002danswers"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revert_002dbuffer_002dquick"></a>
<p>The <kbd class="kbd">C-x x g</kbd> keystroke is bound to the
<code class="code">revert-buffer-quick</code> command.  This is like the
<code class="code">revert-buffer</code> command, but prompts less.  Unlike
<code class="code">revert-buffer</code>, it will not prompt if the current buffer visits
a file, and the buffer is not modified.  It also respects the
<code class="code">revert-buffer-quick-short-answers</code> user option.  If this option
is non-<code class="code">nil</code>, use a shorter <kbd class="kbd">y/n</kbd> query instead of a longer
<kbd class="kbd">yes/no</kbd> query.
</p>
<p>You can also tell Emacs to revert buffers automatically when their
visited files change on disk; see <a class="pxref" href="Auto-Revert.html">Auto Revert: Keeping buffers automatically up-to-date</a>.
