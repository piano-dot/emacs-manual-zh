<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dfree_002dspace"></a>
<p>By default, Dired displays the available space on the directory&rsquo;s
disk on the first line of that directory&rsquo;s listing, following the
directory name.  You can control this display by customizing the
variable <code class="code">dired-free-space</code>.  Its default value is <code class="code">first</code>,
which produces the available space after the directory name.  If you
customize it to the value <code class="code">separate</code> instead, Dired will display
the disk space information on a separate line, following the line with
the directory name, and will include in that line the space used by
the files in the current directory as well as the available disk
space.  If you set this to <code class="code">nil</code>, the available disk space
information will not be displayed at all.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_002b-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dcreate_002ddirectory"></a>
<p>The command <kbd class="kbd">+</kbd> (<code class="code">dired-create-directory</code>) reads a
directory&rsquo;s name, and creates that directory.  It signals an error if
the directory already exists.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dcreate_002dempty_002dfile"></a>
<p>The command (<code class="code">dired-create-empty-file</code>) reads a
file name, and creates that file.  It signals an error if
the file already exists.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-searching-multiple-files-via-Dired"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-M_002ds-a-C_002ds-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-M_002ds-a-M_002dC_002ds-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002ddo_002disearch"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002ddo_002disearch_002dregexp"></a>
<p>The command <kbd class="kbd">M-s a C-s</kbd> (<code class="code">dired-do-isearch</code>) begins a
multi-file incremental search on the marked files.  If a search
fails at the end of a file, typing <kbd class="kbd">C-s</kbd> advances to the next
marked file and repeats the search; at the end of the last marked
file, the search wraps around to the first marked file.  The command
<kbd class="kbd">M-s a M-C-s</kbd> (<code class="code">dired-do-isearch-regexp</code>) does the same with
a regular expression search.  See <a class="xref" href="Repeat-Isearch.html">Repeating Incremental Search</a>, for information
about search repetition.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-adding-to-the-kill-ring-in-Dired"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-w-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dcopy_002dfilename_002das_002dkill"></a>
<p>The command <kbd class="kbd">w</kbd> (<code class="code">dired-copy-filename-as-kill</code>) puts the
names of the marked (or next <var class="var">n</var>) files into the kill ring, as if
you had killed them with <kbd class="kbd">C-w</kbd>.  The names are separated by a
space.
</p>
<p>With a zero prefix argument, this uses the absolute file name of
each marked file.  With just <kbd class="kbd">C-u</kbd> as the prefix argument, it uses
file names relative to the Dired buffer&rsquo;s default directory.  (This
can still contain slashes if in a subdirectory.)  As a special case,
if point is on a directory header line, <kbd class="kbd">w</kbd> gives you the absolute
name of that directory.  Any prefix argument or marked files are
ignored in this case.
</p>
<p>The main purpose of this command is so that you can yank the file
names into arguments for other Emacs commands.  It also displays what
it added to the kill ring, so you can use it to display the list of
currently marked files in the echo area.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-W-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-browse_002durl_002dof_002ddired_002dfile"></a>
<p>If you have an HTML file in the file listing, it can be useful to
view that file with a browser.  The <kbd class="kbd">W</kbd>
(<code class="code">browse-url-of-dired-file</code>) command will use the standard
configured browser to view that file.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_0028-_0028Dired_0029"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dhide_002dsymlink_002dtargets"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dhide_002ddetails_002dhide_002dinformation_002dlines"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hiding-details-in-Dired"></a>
<p>The command <kbd class="kbd">(</kbd> (<code class="code">dired-hide-details-mode</code>) toggles whether
details, such as ownership or file permissions, are visible in the
current Dired buffer.  By default, it also hides the targets of
symbolic links, and all lines other than the header line and
file/directory listings.  To change this, customize the options
<code class="code">dired-hide-details-hide-symlink-targets</code> and
<code class="code">dired-hide-details-hide-information-lines</code>, respectively.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Dired-and-version-control"></a>
<p>If the directory you are visiting is under version control
(see <a class="pxref" href="Version-Control.html">Version Control</a>), then the normal VC diff and log commands
will operate on the selected files.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dcompare_002ddirectories"></a>
<p>The command <kbd class="kbd">M-x dired-compare-directories</kbd> is used to compare
the current Dired buffer with another directory.  It marks all the files
that differ between the two directories.  It puts these marks
in all Dired buffers where these files are listed, which of course includes
the current buffer.
</p>
<p>The default comparison method (used if you type <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> at the
prompt) is to compare just the file names&mdash;file names differ if
they do not appear in the other directory.  You can specify
more stringent comparisons by entering a Lisp expression, which can
refer to the variables <code class="code">size1</code> and <code class="code">size2</code>, the respective
file sizes; <code class="code">mtime1</code> and <code class="code">mtime2</code>, the last modification
times in seconds, as floating point numbers; and <code class="code">fa1</code> and
<code class="code">fa2</code>, the respective file attribute lists (as returned by the
function <code class="code">file-attributes</code>).  This expression is evaluated for
each pair of like-named files, and files differ if the expression&rsquo;s
value is non-<code class="code">nil</code>.
</p>
<p>For instance, the sequence <kbd class="kbd">M-x dired-compare-directories
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd> (&gt; mtime1 mtime2) <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> marks files newer in this
directory than in the other, and marks files older in the other
directory than in this one.  It also marks files with no counterpart,
in both directories, as always.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-drag-and-drop_002c-Dired"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002dmouse_002ddrag_002dfiles"></a>
<p>On the X Window System, Emacs supports the drag and drop protocol.
You can drag a file object from another program, and drop it onto a
Dired buffer; this either moves, copies, or creates a link to the file
in that directory.  Precisely which action is taken is determined by
the originating program.  Dragging files out of a Dired buffer is also
supported, by enabling the user option <code class="code">dired-mouse-drag-files</code>,
the mouse can be used to drag files onto other programs.  When set to
<code class="code">link</code>, it will make the other program (typically a file manager)
create a symbolic link to the file; when set to <code class="code">move</code>, it will
make the other program move the file to a new location, and setting it
to any other non-<code class="code">nil</code> value will make the other program open or
create a copy of the file.  The keyboard modifiers pressed during the
drag-and-drop operation can also control what action the other program
takes towards the file.
