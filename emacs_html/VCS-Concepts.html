<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-repository"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-registered-file"></a>
<p>When a file is under version control, we say that it is
<em class="dfn">registered</em> in the version control system.  The system has a
<em class="dfn">repository</em> which stores both the file&rsquo;s present state and its
change history&mdash;enough to reconstruct the current version or any
earlier version.  The repository also contains other information, such
as <em class="dfn">log entries</em> that describe the changes made to each file.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-work-file"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-checking-out-files"></a>
<p>The copy of a version-controlled file that you actually edit is
called the <em class="dfn">work file</em>.  You can change each work file as you
would an ordinary file.  After you are done with a set of changes, you
may <em class="dfn">commit</em> (or <em class="dfn">check in</em>) the changes; this records the
changes in the repository, along with a descriptive log entry.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-working-tree"></a>
<p>A directory tree of work files is called a <em class="dfn">working tree</em>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revision"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-revision-ID"></a>
<p>Each commit creates a new <em class="dfn">revision</em> in the repository.  The
version control system keeps track of all past revisions and the
changes that were made in each revision.  Each revision is named by a
<em class="dfn">revision ID</em>, whose format depends on the version control system;
in the simplest case, it is just an integer.
</p>
<p>To go beyond these basic concepts, you will need to understand three
aspects in which version control systems differ.  As explained in the
next three sections, they can be lock-based or merge-based; file-based
or changeset-based; and centralized or decentralized.  VC handles all
these modes of operation, but it cannot hide the differences.
