<p>An <em class="dfn">indirect buffer</em> shares the text of some other buffer, which
is called the <em class="dfn">base buffer</em> of the indirect buffer.  In some ways it
is a buffer analogue of a symbolic link between files.
</p>

</p></dd>
<dt><kbd class="kbd">M-x clone-indirect-buffer <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd></dt>
<dd><p>Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer.
</p></dd>

<a id="index-C_002dx-4-c"></a><span><kbd class="kbd">C-x 4 c</kbd><a class="copiable-link" href="#index-C_002dx-4-c"> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>Create an indirect buffer that is a twin copy of the current buffer, and
select it in another window (<code class="code">clone-indirect-buffer-other-window</code>).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The text of the indirect buffer is always identical to the text of its
base buffer; changes made by editing either one are visible immediately
in the other.  &ldquo;Text&rdquo; here includes both the characters and their text
properties.  But in all other respects, the indirect buffer and its
base buffer are completely separate.  They can have different names,
different values of point, different narrowing, different markers,
different overlays, different major modes, and different local variables.
</p>
<p>An indirect buffer cannot visit a file, but its base buffer can.  If
you try to save the indirect buffer, that actually works by saving the
base buffer.  Killing the base buffer effectively kills the indirect
buffer, but killing an indirect buffer has no effect on its base buffer.
</p>
<p>One way to use indirect buffers is to display multiple views of an
outline.  See <a class="xref" href="Outline-Views.html">Viewing One Outline in Multiple Views</a>.
</p>
<p>A quick and handy way to make an indirect buffer is with the command
<kbd class="kbd">C-x 4 c</kbd> (<code class="code">clone-indirect-buffer-other-window</code>).  It creates
and selects an indirect buffer whose base buffer is the current
buffer.  With a numeric argument, it prompts for the name of the
indirect buffer; otherwise it uses the name of the current buffer,
with a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;<var class="var">n</var>&gt;</samp>&rsquo; suffix added.
</p>
<p>The more general way to make an indirect buffer is with the command
<kbd class="kbd">M-x make-indirect-buffer</kbd>.  It creates an indirect buffer
named <var class="var">indirect-name</var> from a buffer <var class="var">base-buffer</var>, prompting for
both using the minibuffer.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-clone_002dindirect_002dbuffer_002dhook"></a>
<p>The functions that create indirect buffers run the hook
<code class="code">clone-indirect-buffer-hook</code> after creating the indirect buffer.
When this hook runs, the newly created indirect buffer is the current
buffer.
</p>
<p>Note: When a modification is made to the text of a buffer, the
modification hooks are run only in the base buffer, because most of
the functions on those hooks are not prepared to work correctly in
indirect buffers.  So if you need a modification hook function in an
indirect buffer, you need to manually add that function to the hook
<em class="emph">in the base buffer</em> and then make the function operate in the
desired indirect buffer.
