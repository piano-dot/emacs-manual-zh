<p>Projects that use a version control system can have two types of log
for changes.  One is the log maintained by the version control system:
each time you commit a change, you fill out a <em class="dfn">log entry</em> for the
change (see <a class="pxref" href="Log-Buffer.html">Features of the Log Entry Buffer</a>).  This is called the <em class="dfn">version control
log</em>.
</p>
<p>The other kind of log is the file <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp> (see <a class="pxref" href="Change-Log.html">Change Logs</a>).  It provides a chronological record of all changes to a large
portion of a program&mdash;typically one directory and its subdirectories.
A small program would use one <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp> file; a large program
may have a <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp> file in each major directory.
See <a class="xref" href="Change-Log.html">Change Logs</a>.  Programmers have used change logs since long
before version control systems.
</p>
<p>Changeset-based version systems typically maintain a changeset-based
modification log for the entire system, which makes change log files
somewhat redundant.  One advantage that they retain is that it is
sometimes useful to be able to view the transaction history of a
single directory separately from those of other directories.  Another
advantage is that commit logs can&rsquo;t be fixed in many version control
systems.
</p>
<p>A project maintained with version control can use just the version
control log, or it can use both kinds of logs.  It can handle some
files one way and some files the other way.  Each project has its
policy, which you should follow.
</p>
<p>When the policy is to use both, you typically want to write an entry
for each change just once, then put it into both logs.  You can write
the entry in <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp>, then copy it to the log buffer with
<kbd class="kbd">C-c C-a</kbd> when committing the change (see <a class="pxref" href="Log-Buffer.html">Features of the Log Entry Buffer</a>).  Or you
can write the entry in the log buffer while committing the change
(with the help of <kbd class="kbd">C-c C-w</kbd>), and later use the <kbd class="kbd">C-x v a</kbd>
command to copy it to <samp class="file">ChangeLog</samp>
(see <a class="pxref" href="Change-Logs-and-VC.html">Change Logs and VC</a>).
