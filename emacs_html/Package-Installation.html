<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dinstall"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dupgrade"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dupgrade_002dall"></a>
<p>Packages are most conveniently installed using the package menu
(see <a class="pxref" href="Package-Menu.html">The Package Menu Buffer</a>), but you can also use the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x
package-install</kbd>.  This prompts for the name of a package with the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">available</samp>&rsquo; status, then downloads and installs it.  Similarly,
if you want to upgrade a package, you can use the <kbd class="kbd">M-x
package-upgrade</kbd> command, and if you want to upgrade all the packages,
you can use the <kbd class="kbd">M-x package-upgrade-all</kbd> command.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dinstall_002dupgrade_002dbuilt_002din"></a>
<p>By default, <code class="code">package-install</code> doesn&rsquo;t consider built-in
packages for which new versions are available from the archives.  (A
package is built-in if it is included in the Emacs distribution.)  In
particular, it will not show built-in packages in the list of
completion candidates when you type at its prompt.  But if you invoke
<code class="code">package-install</code> with a prefix argument, it will also consider
built-in packages that can be upgraded.  You can make this behavior
the default by customizing the variable
<code class="code">package-install-upgrade-built-in</code>: if its value is
non-<code class="code">nil</code>, <code class="code">package-install</code> will consider built-in packages
even when invoked without a prefix argument.  Note that the
package-menu commands (see <a class="pxref" href="Package-Menu.html">The Package Menu Buffer</a>) are also affected by
<code class="code">package-install-upgrade-built-in</code>.
</p>
<p>By contrast, <code class="code">package-upgrade</code> and <code class="code">package-upgrade-all</code>
never consider built-in packages.  If you want to use these commands
for upgrading some built-in packages, you need to upgrade each of
those packages, once, either via <kbd class="kbd">C-u M-x package-install
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>, or by customizing <code class="code">package-install-upgrade-built-in</code>
to a non-<code class="code">nil</code> value, and then upgrading the package once via the
package menu or by <code class="code">package-install</code>.
</p>
<p>If you customize <code class="code">package-install-upgrade-built-in</code> to a
non-<code class="code">nil</code> value, be very careful when using commands that update
many packages at once, like <code class="code">package-upgrade-all</code> and <kbd class="kbd">U</kbd> in
the package menu: those might overwrite built-in packages that you
didn&rsquo;t intent to replace with newer versions from the archives.  Don&rsquo;t
use these bulk commands if you want to update only a small number of
built-in packages.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-requirements"></a>
<p>A package may <em class="dfn">require</em> certain other packages to be installed,
because it relies on functionality provided by them.  When Emacs
installs such a package, it also automatically downloads and installs
any required package that is not already installed.  (If a required
package is somehow unavailable, Emacs signals an error and stops
installation.)  A package&rsquo;s requirements list is shown in its help
buffer.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002darchives"></a>
<p>By default, packages are downloaded from a single package archive
maintained by the Emacs developers.  This is controlled by the
variable <code class="code">package-archives</code>, whose value is a list of package
archives known to Emacs.  Each list element must have the form
<code class="code">(<var class="var">id</var> . <var class="var">location</var>)</code>, where <var class="var">id</var> is the name of a
package archive and <var class="var">location</var> is the <abbr class="acronym">URL</abbr> or
name of the package archive directory.  You can alter this list if you
wish to use third party package archives&mdash;but do so at your own risk,
and use only third parties that you think you can trust!
</p>
<a class="anchor" id="Package-Signing"></a><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-security"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package-signing"></a>
<p>The maintainers of package archives can increase the trust that you
can have in their packages by <em class="dfn">signing</em> them.  They generate a
private/public pair of cryptographic keys, and use the private key to
create a <em class="dfn">signature file</em> for each package.  With the public key, you
can use the signature files to verify the package creator and make sure
the package has not been tampered with.  Signature verification uses
<a class="uref" href="https://www.gnupg.org/">the GnuPG package</a> via the EasyPG
interface (see <a data-manual="epa" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/index.html#Top">EasyPG</a> in <cite class="cite">Emacs EasyPG Assistant Manual</cite>).
A valid signature is not a cast-iron
guarantee that a package is not malicious, so you should still
exercise caution.  Package archives should provide instructions
on how you can obtain their public key.  One way is to download the
key from a server such as <a class="url" href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">https://pgp.mit.edu/</a>.
Use <kbd class="kbd">M-x package-import-keyring</kbd> to import the key into Emacs.
Emacs stores package keys in the directory specified by the variable
<code class="code">package-gnupghome-dir</code>, by default in the <samp class="file">gnupg</samp>
subdirectory of <code class="code">package-user-dir</code>, which causes Emacs to invoke
GnuPG with the option &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--homedir</samp>&rsquo; when verifying signatures.
If <code class="code">package-gnupghome-dir</code> is <code class="code">nil</code>, GnuPG&rsquo;s option
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">--homedir</samp>&rsquo; is omitted.
The public key for the GNU package archive is distributed with Emacs,
in the <samp class="file">etc/package-keyring.gpg</samp>.  Emacs uses it automatically.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dcheck_002dsignature"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dunsigned_002darchives"></a>
<p>If the user option <code class="code">package-check-signature</code> is non-<code class="code">nil</code>,
Emacs attempts to verify signatures when you install packages.  If the
option has the value <code class="code">allow-unsigned</code>, and a usable OpenPGP
configuration is found, signed packages will be checked, but you can
still install a package that is not signed.  If you use some archives
that do not sign their packages, you can add them to the list
<code class="code">package-unsigned-archives</code>.  (If the value is
<code class="code">allow-unsigned</code> and no usable OpenPGP is found, this option is
treated as if its value was <code class="code">nil</code>.)  If the value is <code class="code">t</code>, at
least one signature must be valid; if the value is <code class="code">all</code>, all of
them must be valid.
</p>
<p>For more information on cryptographic keys and signing,
see <a data-manual="gnupg" href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/index.html#Top">GnuPG</a> in <cite class="cite">The GNU Privacy Guard Manual</cite>.
Emacs comes with an interface to GNU Privacy Guard,
see <a data-manual="epa" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/index.html#Top">EasyPG</a> in <cite class="cite">Emacs EasyPG Assistant Manual</cite>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dpinned_002dpackages"></a>
<p>If you have more than one package archive enabled, and some of them
offer different versions of the same package, you may find the option
<code class="code">package-pinned-packages</code> useful.  You can add package/archive
pairs to this list, to ensure that the specified package is only ever
downloaded from the specified archive.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002darchive_002dpriorities"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dmenu_002dhide_002dlow_002dpriority"></a>
<p>Another option that is useful when you have several package archives
enabled is <code class="code">package-archive-priorities</code>.  It specifies the
priority of each archive (higher numbers specify higher priority
archives).  By default, archives have the priority of zero, unless
specified otherwise by this option&rsquo;s value.  Packages from
lower-priority archives will not be shown in the menu, if the same
package is available from a higher-priority archive.  (This is
controlled by the value of <code class="code">package-menu-hide-low-priority</code>.)
</p>
<p>Once a package is downloaded, byte-compiled and installed, it is
made available to the current Emacs session.  Making a package
available adds its directory to <code class="code">load-path</code> and loads its
autoloads.  The effect of a package&rsquo;s autoloads varies from package to
package.  Most packages just make some new commands available, while
others have more wide-ranging effects on the Emacs session.  For such
information, consult the package&rsquo;s help buffer.
</p>
<p>Installed packages are automatically made available by Emacs in all
subsequent sessions.  This happens at startup, before processing the
init file but after processing the early init file (see <a class="pxref" href="Early-Init-File.html">The Early Init File</a>).  As an exception, Emacs does not make packages available at
startup if invoked with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-q</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp class="samp">--no-init-file</samp>&rsquo; options
(see <a class="pxref" href="Initial-Options.html">Initial Options</a>).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002denable_002dat_002dstartup"></a>
<p>To keep Emacs from automatically making packages available at
startup, change the variable <code class="code">package-enable-at-startup</code> to
<code class="code">nil</code>.  You must do this in the early init file, as the variable
is read before loading the regular init file.  Currently this variable
cannot be set via Customize.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dquickstart_002drefresh"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dquickstart"></a>
<p>If you have many packages installed, you can improve startup times
by setting the user option <code class="code">package-quickstart</code> to <code class="code">t</code>.
Setting this option will make Emacs precompute many things instead of
re-computing them on every Emacs startup.  However, if you do this,
then you have to manually run the command
<code class="code">package-quickstart-refresh</code> when the activations need to be
changed, such as when you change the value of
<code class="code">package-load-list</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dactivate_002dall"></a>
<p>If you have set <code class="code">package-enable-at-startup</code> to <code class="code">nil</code>, you
can still make packages available either during or after startup.  To
make installed packages available during startup, call the function
<code class="code">package-activate-all</code> in your init file.  To make installed
packages available after startup, invoke the command <kbd class="kbd">M-:
(package-activate-all) RET</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002dload_002dlist"></a>
<p>For finer control over which packages are made available at startup,
you can use the variable <code class="code">package-load-list</code>.  Its value should
be a list.  A list element of the form <code class="code">(<var class="var">name</var>&nbsp;<var class="var">version</var>)</code><!-- /@w --> tells Emacs to make available version <var class="var">version</var> of
the package named <var class="var">name</var>.  Here, <var class="var">version</var> should be a version
string (corresponding to a specific version of the package), or
<code class="code">t</code> (which means to make available any installed version), or
<code class="code">nil</code> (which means no version; this disables the package,
preventing it from being made available).  A list element can also be
the symbol <code class="code">all</code>, which means to make available the latest
installed version of any package not named by the other list elements.
The default value is just <code class="code">'(all)</code>.
</p>
<p>For example, if you set <code class="code">package-load-list</code> to <code class="code">'((muse&nbsp;&quot;3.20&quot;)&nbsp;all)</code><!-- /@w -->, then Emacs only makes available version 3.20 of the
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo; package, plus any installed version of packages other than
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo;.  Any other version of &lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo; that happens to be
installed will be ignored.  The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">muse</samp>&rsquo; package will be listed in
the package menu with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">held</samp>&rsquo; status.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002drecompile"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-package_002drecompile_002dall"></a>
<p>Emacs byte code is quite stable, but it&rsquo;s possible for byte code to
become outdated, or for the compiled files to rely on macros that have
changed in new versions of Emacs.  You can use the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;package-recompile</kbd><!-- /@w --> to recompile a particular package, or
<kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;package-recompile-all</kbd><!-- /@w --> to recompile all the packages.  (The
latter command might take quite a while to run if you have many
installed packages.)
