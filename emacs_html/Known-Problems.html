<p>Before reporting a bug, if at all possible, please check to see if
we already know about it.  Indeed, it may already have been fixed in a
later release of Emacs, or in the development version.  Here is a list
of the main places you can read about known issues:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>The <samp class="file">etc/PROBLEMS</samp> file; type <kbd class="kbd">C-h C-p</kbd> to read it.  This
file contains a list of particularly well-known issues that have been
encountered in compiling, installing and running Emacs, with special
emphasis on issues caused by other software that cannot be easily
solved in Emacs.  Often, you will find there suggestions for
workarounds and solutions.

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bug-tracker"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-issue-tracker"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-search-known-bugs"></a>
The GNU Bug Tracker at <a class="url" href="https://debbugs.gnu.org">https://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.  Emacs bugs and
issues are filed in the tracker under the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">emacs</samp>&rsquo; package.  The
tracker records information about the status of each bug, the initial
bug report, and the follow-up messages by the bug reporter and Emacs
developers who participate in discussing and fixing the bug.  You can
search for bugs by subject, severity, and other criteria.  For more
complex search criteria, use
<a class="url" href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/search.cgi">https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/search.cgi</a>.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debbugs-package"></a>
<p>Instead of browsing the bug tracker as a web page, you can browse it
from Emacs using the <code class="code">debbugs</code> package, which can be downloaded
via the Package Menu (see <a class="pxref" href="Packages.html">Emacs Lisp Packages</a>).  This package provides the
command <kbd class="kbd">M-x debbugs-gnu</kbd> to list bugs, and <kbd class="kbd">M-x
debbugs-gnu-search</kbd> to search for a specific bug.  User tags, applied
by the Emacs maintainers, are shown by <kbd class="kbd">M-x debbugs-gnu-usertags</kbd>.
</p>
</li><li>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</samp>&rsquo; mailing list (also available as the newsgroup
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">gnu.emacs.bug</samp>&rsquo;).  You can read the list archives at
<a class="url" href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs">https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs</a>.  This list
works as a mirror of the Emacs bug reports and follow-up messages
which are sent to the bug tracker.  It also contains old bug reports
from before the bug tracker was introduced (in early 2008).

<p>If you like, you can subscribe to the list.  Be aware that its purpose
is to provide the Emacs maintainers with information about bugs and
feature requests, so reports may contain fairly large amounts of data;
spectators should not complain about this.
</p>
</li><li>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">emacs-pretest-bug</samp>&rsquo; mailing list.  This list is no longer
used, and is mainly of historical interest.  At one time, it was used
for bug reports in development (i.e., not yet released) versions of
Emacs.  You can read the archives for 2003 to mid 2007 at
<a class="url" href="https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-pretest-bug/">https://lists.gnu.org/r/emacs-pretest-bug/</a>.  Nowadays,
email messages sent to this list are redirected to
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</samp>&rsquo;.

</li><li>The &lsquo;<samp class="samp">emacs-devel</samp>&rsquo; mailing list.  Sometimes people report bugs to
this mailing list.  This is not the main purpose of the list, however,
and it is much better to send bug reports to the bug list.  You should
not feel obliged to read this list before reporting a bug.
