<p>While developing a branch, you may sometimes need to <em class="dfn">merge</em> in
changes that have already been made in another branch.  This is not a
trivial operation, as overlapping and conflicting changes may have
been made to the two branches.
</p>
<p>With a decentralized version control system, you merge changes with
the command <kbd class="kbd">C-x v m</kbd> (<code class="code">vc-merge</code>).  With Bazaar, this
prompts for the exact arguments to pass to the <code class="command">bzr merge</code>
command, offering a sensible default if possible.  With Git, this
prompts for the name of a branch to merge from, with completion (based
on the branch names known to the current repository).  With Mercurial,
this prompts for argument to pass to <code class="command">hg merge</code>.  The output
from running the merge command is shown in a separate buffer.
</p>
<p>With a centralized version control system like CVS, <kbd class="kbd">C-x v m</kbd>
prompts for a branch ID, or a pair of revision IDs (see <a class="pxref" href="Switching-Branches.html">Switching between Branches</a>); then it finds the changes from that branch, or the changes
between the two revisions you specified, and merges those changes into
the current VC fileset.  If you just type <kbd class="kbd"><kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> at the
prompt, Emacs simply merges any changes that were made on the same
branch since you checked the file out.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-conflicts_002c-VC"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-resolving-conflicts"></a>
<p>Immediately after performing a merge, only the working tree is
modified, and you can review the changes produced by the merge with
<kbd class="kbd">C-x v D</kbd> and related commands (see <a class="pxref" href="Old-Revisions.html">Examining And Comparing Old Revisions</a>).  If the
two branches contained overlapping changes, merging produces a
<em class="dfn">conflict</em>; a warning appears in the output of the merge command,
and <em class="dfn">conflict markers</em> are inserted into each affected work file,
surrounding the two sets of conflicting changes.  You must then
resolve the conflict by editing the conflicted files; by default,
Emacs will place buffers with VC conflicts in the special Smerge mode,
which provides special commands for resolving the merge conflicts.
Once you are done with resolving the conflicts and have saved the
files with resolved conflicts, those files must be committed in the
usual way for the merge to take effect (see <a class="pxref" href="Basic-VC-Editing.html">Basic Editing under Version Control</a>).
