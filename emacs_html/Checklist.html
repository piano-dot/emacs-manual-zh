<h3 class="section subsection-level-set-section" id="Checklist-for-Bug-Reports"><span>40.4 Checklist for Bug Reports<a class="copiable-link" href="#Checklist-for-Bug-Reports"> &para;</a></span></h3>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-checklist-before-reporting-a-bug"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bug-reporting_002c-checklist"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-report-bugs-in-Emacs"></a>

<p>Before reporting a bug, first try to see if the problem has already
been reported (see <a class="pxref" href="Known-Problems.html">Reading Existing Bug Reports and Known Problems</a>).
</p>
<p>If you are able to, try the latest release of Emacs to see if the
problem has already been fixed.  Even better is to try the latest
development version.  We recognize that this is not easy for some
people, so do not feel that you absolutely must do this before making
a report.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-report_002demacs_002dbug"></a>
<p>The best way to write a bug report for Emacs is to use the command
<kbd class="kbd">M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd>.  This sets up a mail buffer
(see <a class="pxref" href="Sending-Mail.html">Sending Mail</a>) and automatically inserts <em class="emph">some</em> of the
essential information.  However, it cannot supply all the necessary
information; you should still read and follow the guidelines below, so
you can enter the other crucial information by hand before you send
the message.  You may feel that some of the information inserted by
<kbd class="kbd">M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> is not relevant, but unless you are
absolutely sure, it is best to leave it, so that the developers can
decide for themselves.
</p>
<p>When you have finished writing your report, type <kbd class="kbd">C-c C-c</kbd> and it
will be sent to the Emacs maintainers at
<a class="url" href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs">bug-gnu-emacs</a>.
If you cannot send mail from inside Emacs, you can copy the
text of your report to your normal mail client (if your system
supports it, you can type <kbd class="kbd">C-c M-i</kbd> to have Emacs do this for you)
and send it to that address.  Or you can simply send an email to that
address describing the problem, including the necessary information
mentioned below.
</p>
<p>If you want to submit code to Emacs (to fix a problem or implement a
new feature), the easiest way to do this is to send a patch to the
Emacs issue tracker.  Use the <kbd class="kbd">M-x submit-emacs-patch</kbd> command for
that, which works much the same as when reporting bugs; see <a class="pxref" href="Sending-Patches.html">Sending Patches for GNU Emacs</a>.
</p>
<p>In any case, your report will be sent to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</samp>&rsquo;
mailing list, and stored in the GNU Bug Tracker at
<a class="url" href="https://debbugs.gnu.org">https://debbugs.gnu.org</a>.  Please include a valid reply email
address, in case we need to ask you for more information about your
report.  Submissions are moderated, so there may be a delay before
your report actually appears on the tracker.
</p>
<p>You do not need to know how the GNU Bug Tracker works in order to
report a bug, but if you want to, you can read the tracker&rsquo;s
<a class="uref" href="https://debbugs.gnu.org/Advanced.html">online documentation</a> to
see the various features you can use.
</p>
<p>All mail sent to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">bug-gnu-emacs</samp>&rsquo; mailing list is also
gatewayed to the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">gnu.emacs.bug</samp>&rsquo; newsgroup.  The reverse is also
true, but we ask you not to post bug reports (or replies) via the
newsgroup.  It can make it much harder to contact you if we need to ask
for more information, and it does not integrate well with the bug
tracker.
</p>
<p>If your data is more than 500,000 bytes, please don&rsquo;t include it
directly in the bug report; instead, offer to send it on request, or
make it available online and say where.  Large attachments are best
sent compressed.
</p>
<p>The GNU Bug Tracker will assign a bug number to your report; please
use it in the following discussions, keeping the bug address in the
list of recipients, so that the bug discussion is recorded by the
tracker.  The bug address will look like
&lsquo;<samp class="samp"><var class="var">nnnnn</var>@debbugs.gnu.org</samp>&rsquo;, where <var class="var">nnnnn</var> is the bug
number.
</p>
<p>To enable maintainers to investigate a bug, your report
should include all these things:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>A description of what behavior you observe that you believe is
incorrect.  For example, &ldquo;The Emacs process gets a fatal signal&rdquo;, or,
&ldquo;The resulting text is as follows, which I think is wrong.&rdquo;

<p>Of course, if the bug is that Emacs gets a fatal signal, then one can&rsquo;t
miss it.  But if the bug is incorrect text, the maintainer might fail to
notice what is wrong.  Why leave it to chance?
</p>
<p>Even if the problem you experience is a fatal signal, you should still
say so explicitly.  Suppose something strange is going on, such as, your
copy of the source is out of sync, or you have encountered a bug in the
C library on your system.  (This has happened!)  Your copy might crash
and the copy here might not.  If you <em class="emph">said</em> to expect a crash, then
when Emacs here fails to crash, we would know that the bug was not
happening.  If you don&rsquo;t say to expect a crash, then we would not know
whether the bug was happening&mdash;we would not be able to draw any
conclusion from our observations.
</p>
<p>Usually, description of the behavior and of the way to reproduce the
problem needs to specify one or more of the following aspects:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-minus">
<li>The complete text of any files needed to reproduce the bug.

<p>If you can tell us a way to cause the problem without visiting any files,
please do so.  This makes it much easier to debug.  If you do need files,
make sure you arrange for us to see their exact contents.  For example, it
can matter whether there are spaces at the ends of lines, or a
newline after the last line in the buffer (nothing ought to care whether
the last line is terminated, but try telling the bugs that).
</p>
</li><li>The precise commands we need to type to reproduce the bug.  If at all
possible, give a full recipe for an Emacs started with the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-Q</samp>&rsquo;
option (see <a class="pxref" href="Initial-Options.html">Initial Options</a>).  This bypasses your personal
customizations.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-open_002ddribble_002dfile"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dribble-file"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-logging-keystrokes"></a>
<p>One way to record the input to Emacs precisely is to write a dribble
file.  To start the file, use the command <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;open-dribble-file</kbd><!-- /@w -->.
From then on, Emacs copies all your input to the specified dribble
file until the Emacs process is killed.  Be aware that sensitive
information (such as passwords) may end up recorded in the dribble
file.
</p>
</li><li>If the bug is that the Emacs Manual or the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual
fails to describe the actual behavior of Emacs, or that the text is
confusing, copy in the text from the manual which you think is
at fault.  If the section is small, just the section name is enough.

</li><li>If the manifestation of the bug is an Emacs error message, it is
important to report the precise text of the error message, and a
backtrace showing how the Lisp program in Emacs arrived at the error.

<p>To get the error message text accurately, copy it from the
<samp class="file">*Messages*</samp> buffer into the bug report.  Copy all of it, not just
part.
</p>
</li><li>Check whether any programs you have loaded into the Lisp world,
including your initialization file, set any variables that may affect
the functioning of Emacs.  Also, see whether the problem happens in a
freshly started Emacs without loading your initialization file (start
Emacs with the <code class="code">-Q</code> switch to prevent loading the init files).
If the problem does <em class="emph">not</em> occur then, you must report the precise
contents of any programs that you must load into the Lisp world in
order to cause the problem to occur.

</li><li>If the problem does depend on an init file or other Lisp programs that
are not part of the standard Emacs system, then you should make sure it
is not a bug in those programs by complaining to their maintainers
first.  After they verify that they are using Emacs in a way that is
supposed to work, they should report the bug.

</li><li>If you wish to mention something in the GNU Emacs source, show the line
of code with a few lines of context.  Don&rsquo;t just give a line number.

<p>The line numbers in the development sources don&rsquo;t match those in your
sources.  It would take extra work for the maintainers to determine what
code is in your version at a given line number, and we could not be
certain.
</p>
</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-open_002dtermscript"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-termscript-file"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-TERM_002c-environment-variable_002c-and-display-bugs"></a>
For possible display bugs on text-mode terminals, the terminal type
(the value of environment variable <code class="env">TERM</code>), the complete termcap
entry for the terminal from <samp class="file">/etc/termcap</samp> (since that file is
not identical on all machines), and the output that Emacs actually
sent to the terminal.

<p>The way to collect the terminal output is to invoke the command
<kbd class="kbd">M-x open-termscript</kbd> just after starting Emacs; it will prompt
you for the name of the file where to record all terminal output until
the Emacs process is killed.  If the problem happens when Emacs starts
up, put the Lisp expression
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(open-termscript &quot;~/termscript&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>into your Emacs initialization file so that the termscript file will
be open when Emacs displays the screen for the first time.
</p>
<p>Be warned: it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to fix a
terminal-dependent bug without access to a terminal of the type that
stimulates the bug.
</p></li></ul>

</li><li>The version number of Emacs.  Without this, we won&rsquo;t know whether there is any
point in looking for the bug in the current version of GNU Emacs.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-emacs_002dversion"></a>
<p><kbd class="kbd">M-x report-emacs-bug</kbd> includes this information automatically,
but if you are not using that command for your report you can get the
version number by typing <kbd class="kbd">M-x emacs-version <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd>.  If that
command does not work, you probably have something other than GNU
Emacs, so you will have to report the bug somewhere else.
</p>
</li><li>The type of machine you are using, and the operating system name and
version number (again, automatically included by <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;report-emacs-bug</kbd><!-- /@w -->).  <kbd class="kbd">M-x&nbsp;emacs-version&nbsp;<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd><!-- /@w --> provides
this information too.  Copy its output from the <samp class="file">*Messages*</samp>
buffer, so that you get it all and get it accurately, or use
<kbd class="kbd">C-u&nbsp;M-x&nbsp;emacs-version&nbsp;<kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd><!-- /@w --> to insert the version
information into the current buffer.

</li><li>The command-line arguments given to the <code class="code">configure</code> command when
Emacs was built (automatically included by <kbd class="kbd">M-x
report-emacs-bug</kbd>).

</li><li>A complete list of any modifications you have made to the Emacs source.
(We may not have time to investigate the bug unless it happens in an
unmodified Emacs.  But if you&rsquo;ve made modifications and you don&rsquo;t tell
us, you are sending us on a wild goose chase.)

<p>Be precise about these changes.  A description in English is not
enough&mdash;send a unified context diff for them.
</p>
<p>Adding files of your own, or porting to another machine, is a
modification of the source.
</p>
</li><li>Details of any other deviations from the standard procedure for installing
GNU Emacs.

</li><li>If non-<abbr class="acronym">ASCII</abbr> text or internationalization is relevant, the locale that
was current when you started Emacs.   This is automatically included by <kbd class="kbd">M-x
report-emacs-bug</kbd>; alternatively, on GNU/Linux and Unix systems, or
if you use a POSIX-style shell such as Bash, you can use this shell
command to view the relevant values:

<div class="example smallexample">
<pre class="example-preformatted">echo LC_ALL=$LC_ALL LC_COLLATE=$LC_COLLATE LC_CTYPE=$LC_CTYPE \
  LC_MESSAGES=$LC_MESSAGES LC_TIME=$LC_TIME LANG=$LANG
</pre></div>

<p>You can also use the <code class="command">locale</code> command, if your system has it,
to display your locale settings.
</p></li></ul>

<p>Here are some things that are not necessary in a bug report:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>A description of the envelope of the bug&mdash;this is not necessary for a
reproducible bug.

<p>Often people who encounter a bug spend a lot of time investigating
which changes to the input file will make the bug go away and which
changes will not affect it.
</p>
<p>This is often time-consuming and not very useful, because the way we
will find the bug is by running a single example under the debugger
with breakpoints, not by pure deduction from a series of examples.
You might as well save time by not searching for additional examples.
It is better to send the bug report right away, go back to editing,
and find another bug to report.
</p>
<p>Of course, if you can find a simpler example to report <em class="emph">instead</em> of
the original one, that is a convenience.  Errors in the output will be
easier to spot, running under the debugger will take less time, etc.
</p>
<p>However, simplification is not vital; if you can&rsquo;t do this or don&rsquo;t have
time to try, please report the bug with your original test case.
</p>
</li><li>A core dump file.

<p>Debugging the core dump might be useful, but it can only be done on
your machine, with your Emacs executable.  Therefore, sending the core
dump file to the Emacs maintainers won&rsquo;t be useful.  Above all, don&rsquo;t
include the core file in an email bug report!  Such a large message
can be extremely inconvenient.
</p>
</li><li>A system-call trace of Emacs execution.

<p>System-call traces are very useful for certain special kinds of
debugging, but in most cases they give little useful information.  It is
therefore strange that many people seem to think that <em class="emph">the</em> way to
report information about a crash is to send a system-call trace.  Perhaps
this is a habit formed from experience debugging programs that don&rsquo;t
have source code or debugging symbols.
</p>
<p>In most programs, a backtrace is normally far, far more informative than
a system-call trace.  Even in Emacs, a simple backtrace is generally
more informative, though to give full information you should supplement
the backtrace by displaying variable values and printing them as Lisp
objects with <code class="code">pr</code> (see above).
</p>
</li><li>A patch for the bug.

<p>A patch for the bug is useful if it is a good one.  But don&rsquo;t omit the
other information that a bug report needs, such as the test case, on
the assumption that a patch is sufficient.  We might see problems with
your patch and decide to fix the problem another way, or we might not
understand it at all.  And if we can&rsquo;t understand what bug you are
trying to fix, or why your patch should be an improvement, we mustn&rsquo;t
install it.  See <a class="xref" href="Sending-Patches.html">Sending Patches for GNU Emacs</a>, for guidelines on how to make it
easy for us to understand and install your patches.
</p>
</li><li>A guess about what the bug is or what it depends on.

<p>Such guesses are usually wrong.  Even experts can&rsquo;t guess right about
such things without first using the debugger to find the facts.
</p></li></ul>

<p>If you are willing to debug Emacs and provide additional information
about the bug, here is some useful advice:
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-toggle_002ddebug_002don_002derror"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Edebug"></a>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>If the bug manifests itself as an error message, try providing a Lisp
backtrace for the error.  To make a backtrace for the error, use
<kbd class="kbd">M-x toggle-debug-on-error</kbd> before the error happens (that is to
say, you must give that command and then make the bug happen).  This
causes the error to start the Lisp debugger, which shows you a
backtrace.  Copy the text of the debugger&rsquo;s backtrace into the bug
report.  (The backtrace is more detailed if you load the relevant Lisp
<samp class="file">*.el</samp> source files before triggering the error, so do that if
you know how to find and load those files.)

<p>To debug the error, we suggest using Edebug.  See <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Edebug.html#Edebug">Edebug</a> in <cite class="cite">the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>, for information on debugging
Emacs Lisp programs with the Edebug package.
</p>
<p>This use of the debugger is possible only if you know how to make the
bug happen again.  If you can&rsquo;t make it happen again, at least copy
the whole error message.
</p>
</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debug_002don_002dquit"></a>
If Emacs appears to be stuck in an infinite loop or in a very long
operation, typing <kbd class="kbd">C-g</kbd> with the variable <code class="code">debug-on-quit</code>
non-<code class="code">nil</code> will start the Lisp debugger and show a backtrace.
This backtrace is useful for debugging such long loops, so if you can
produce it, copy it into the bug report.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debug_002don_002devent"></a>
<p>If you cannot get Emacs to respond to <kbd class="kbd">C-g</kbd> (e.g., because
<code class="code">inhibit-quit</code> is set), then you can try sending the signal
specified by <code class="code">debug-on-event</code> (default SIGUSR2) from outside
Emacs to cause it to enter the debugger.
</p>
</li><li>Additional information from a C debugger such as GDB might enable
someone to find a problem on a machine which he does not have available.
If you don&rsquo;t know how to use GDB, please read the GDB manual&mdash;it is not
very long, and using GDB is easy.  You can find the GDB distribution,
including the GDB manual in online form, in most of the same places you
can find the Emacs distribution.  To run Emacs under GDB, you should
switch to the <samp class="file">src</samp> subdirectory in which Emacs was compiled, then
type <kbd class="kbd">gdb ./emacs</kbd>.  It is important for the directory <samp class="file">src</samp> to be
current so that GDB will read the <samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp> file in this
directory.  (You can also tell GDB to read that file from inside GDB,
by typing <kbd class="kbd">source ./.gdbinit</kbd>.)

<p>However, you need to think when you collect the additional information
if you want it to show what causes the bug.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-backtrace-for-bug-reports"></a>
<p>For example, many people send just a C-level backtrace, but that is
not very useful by itself.  A simple backtrace with arguments often
conveys little about what is happening inside GNU Emacs, because most
of the arguments listed in the backtrace are pointers to Lisp objects.
The numeric values of these pointers have no significance whatever;
all that matters is the contents of the objects they point to (and
most of the contents are themselves pointers).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debug_005fprint"></a>
<p>To provide useful information, you need to show the values of Lisp
objects in Lisp notation.  Do this for each variable which is a Lisp
object, in several stack frames near the bottom of the stack.  Look at
the source to see which variables are Lisp objects, because the debugger
thinks of them as integers.
</p>
<p>To show a variable&rsquo;s value in Lisp syntax, first print its value, then
use the user-defined GDB command <code class="code">pr</code> to print the Lisp object in
Lisp syntax.  (If you must use another debugger, call the function
<code class="code">debug_print</code> with the object as an argument.)  The <code class="code">pr</code>
command is defined by the file <samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp>, and it works only if you
are debugging a running process (not with a core dump).
</p>
<p>To make Lisp errors stop Emacs and return to GDB, put a breakpoint at
<code class="code">Fsignal</code>.
</p>
<p>For a backtrace of Lisp functions running, type the GDB command
<code class="code">xbacktrace</code>.
</p>
<p>The file <samp class="file">.gdbinit</samp> defines several other commands that are useful
for examining the data types and contents of Lisp objects.  Their names
begin with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">x</samp>&rsquo;.  These commands work at a lower level than
<code class="code">pr</code>, and are less convenient, but they may work even when
<code class="code">pr</code> does not, such as when debugging a core dump or when Emacs has
had a fatal signal.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-debugging-Emacs_002c-tricks-and-techniques"></a>
<p>More detailed advice and other useful techniques for debugging Emacs
are available in the file <samp class="file">etc/DEBUG</samp> in the Emacs distribution.
That file also includes instructions for investigating problems
whereby Emacs stops responding (many people assume that Emacs is
&ldquo;hung&rdquo;, whereas in fact it might be in an infinite loop).
</p>
<p>To find the file <samp class="file">etc/DEBUG</samp> in your Emacs installation, use the
directory name stored in the variable <code class="code">data-directory</code>.
</p></li></ul>
