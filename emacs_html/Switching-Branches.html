<p>The various version control systems differ in how branches are
implemented, and these differences cannot be entirely concealed by VC.
</p>
<p>On some decentralized version control systems, including Bazaar and
Mercurial in its normal mode of operation, each branch has its own
working directory tree, so switching between branches just involves
switching directories.  On Git, branches are normally <em class="dfn">co-located</em>
in the same directory, and switching between branches is done using
the <kbd class="kbd">git checkout</kbd> command, which changes the contents of the
working tree to match the branch you switch to.  Bazaar also supports
co-located branches, in which case the <kbd class="kbd">bzr switch</kbd> command
will switch branches in the current directory.  With Subversion, you
switch to another branch using the <kbd class="kbd">svn switch</kbd> command.  With
Mercurial, command <kbd class="kbd">hg update</kbd> is used to switch to another
branch.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-v-b-s"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-vc_002dswitch_002dbranch"></a>
<p>The VC command to switch to another branch in the current directory
is <kbd class="kbd">C-x v b s <var class="var">branch-name</var> <kbd class="key">RET</kbd></kbd> (<code class="code">vc-switch-branch</code>).
</p>
<p>On centralized version control systems, you can also switch between
branches by typing <kbd class="kbd">C-u C-x v v</kbd> in an up-to-date work file
(see <a class="pxref" href="Advanced-C_002dx-v-v.html">Advanced Control in <kbd class="kbd">C-x v v</kbd></a>), and entering the revision ID for a
revision on another branch.  On CVS, for instance, revisions on the
<em class="dfn">trunk</em> (the main line of development) normally have IDs of the
form 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, &hellip;, while the first branch created from (say)
revision 1.2 has revision IDs 1.2.1.1, 1.2.1.2, &hellip;, the second
branch created from revision 1.2 has revision IDs 1.2.2.1, 1.2.2.2,
&hellip;, and so forth.  You can also specify the <em class="dfn">branch ID</em>,
which is a branch revision ID omitting its final component
(e.g., 1.2.1), to switch to the latest revision on that branch.
</p>
<p>On a locking-based system, switching to a different branch also
unlocks (write-protects) the working tree.
</p>
<p>Once you have switched to a branch, VC commands will apply to that
branch until you switch away; for instance, any VC filesets that you
commit will be committed to that specific branch.
