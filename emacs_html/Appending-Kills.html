<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-appending-kills-in-the-ring"></a>
<p>Normally, each kill command pushes a new entry onto the kill ring.
However, two or more kill commands in a row combine their text into a
single entry, so that a single <kbd class="kbd">C-y</kbd> yanks all the text as a unit,
just as it was before it was killed.
</p>
<p>Thus, if you want to yank text as a unit, you need not kill all of it
with one command; you can keep killing line after line, or word after
word, until you have killed it all, and you can still get it all back at
once.
</p>
<p>Commands that kill forward from point add onto the end of the previous
killed text.  Commands that kill backward from point add text onto the
beginning.  This way, any sequence of mixed forward and backward kill
commands puts all the killed text into one entry without rearrangement.
Numeric arguments do not break the sequence of appending kills.  For
example, suppose the buffer contains this text:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">This is a line &lowast;of sample text.
</pre></div>

<p>with point shown by &lowast;.  If you type <kbd class="kbd">M-d M-<kbd class="key">DEL</kbd> M-d
M-<kbd class="key">DEL</kbd></kbd>, killing alternately forward and backward, you end up with
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">a line of sample</samp>&rsquo; as one entry in the kill ring, and
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">This&nbsp;is&nbsp;&nbsp;text.</samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w --> in the buffer.  (Note the double space
between &lsquo;<samp class="samp">is</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">text</samp>&rsquo;, which you can clean up with
<kbd class="kbd">M-<kbd class="key">SPC</kbd></kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">M-q</kbd>.)
</p>
<p>Another way to kill the same text is to move back two words with
<kbd class="kbd">M-b M-b</kbd>, then kill all four words forward with <kbd class="kbd">C-u M-d</kbd>.
This produces exactly the same results in the buffer and in the kill
ring.  <kbd class="kbd">M-f M-f C-u M-<kbd class="key">DEL</kbd></kbd> kills the same text, all going
backward; once again, the result is the same.  The text in the kill ring
entry always has the same order that it had in the buffer before you
killed it.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dM_002dw"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-append_002dnext_002dkill"></a>
<p>If a kill command is separated from the last kill command by other
commands (not just numeric arguments), it starts a new entry on the
kill ring.  But you can force it to combine with the last killed text,
by typing <kbd class="kbd">C-M-w</kbd> (<code class="code">append-next-kill</code>) right beforehand.  The
<kbd class="kbd">C-M-w</kbd> tells its following command, if it is a kill command, to
treat the kill as part of the sequence of previous kills.  As usual,
the kill is appended to the previous killed text if the command kills
forward, and prepended if the command kills backward.  In this way,
you can kill several separated pieces of text and accumulate them to
be yanked back in one place.
</p>
<p>A kill command following <kbd class="kbd">M-w</kbd> (<code class="code">kill-ring-save</code>) does not
append to the text that <kbd class="kbd">M-w</kbd> copied into the kill ring.
